# Hin und Weg

Created for/during the [MÜNSTERHACK 2023](https://www.muensterhack.de/), Hin und Weg aims to provide users in Münster a way to see where they can donate unused items. To use this app you also need to run the [Backend](https://github.com/BenniMsHack/mshack23backend), you may also provide a Google Maps API key in the Map.tsx file to show routes/distances from the users current location to a selected target.
